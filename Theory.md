# Difference Between A Library And FrameWork?

  => Library 
            => Library Is Collection Of Pre-Written Code That Can Be Used To Perform Common Tasks Or Add Specific. Library Provides Pre-Written And Tested And Debugged Code That Can Be Reused Across Projects.
  
  => Framework
            => A Framework Is A Software Plateform That Provides Developers With Pre-Built Tools And Libraries To Simplify To The Development Of Web Applications.
 
  => Difference
            => A FrameWork Is Collection Of Pre-Written Code That Provides A Structure For Devloping Applications. A Library On Other Hand Is A Collection Of Pre-Written Code That Can Be Used To Perform Specific Task.
            => A Framework Defines The OverAll Architecture Of The Application And Provides A Common Set Of Conventions For Building And Maintaining The Code.Library Is Typically Smaller In Scope Than A Framework And Is Intended To Be Used As A Tool To Help Devlopers Accomplish Specific Tasks.


# What Is CDN? Why Do We Use It?
            => CDN Is Content Delivery Network CDN Is Geographycally Distributed Group Of Servers That Caches Content Close To End Users. A CDN Allows For The Quick Transfer Of Assets Needed For Loading Internet Content.
            
            # Reasons For Why We Use CDN
                                        => Improving Website LoadTimes By Distributing Content Closer To Website Visitors By Using CDN Server Visitors Experience Faster Page Loading Time.
                                        => Reducing Bandwidth Costs Bandwidth Consumption Costs For Website Hosting Is A Primary Expense For Websites,Through Caching And Other Optimizations CDNs Are Able To Reduce Thair Ammount Of The Data And Origin Server Must Provide.
                                        => Improve Website Security-A CDN May Improve Security By Providing DDos Mitigation Improvements To Security Certificates.

# Why React Known As React?

            => The Crossorigin Attribute Set The Mode Of The Request To An HTTP CORS Request.Web Pages Often Make Request To Load Resources On Other Server.
          
# What Is Difference Between React And ReactDOM?
            => React Is A Javascript Library For Building UserInterfaces And React Dom Is Javascript Library That Allows React To Interact With Dom.
      
# What Is Difference Between React.devlopment.js And React.production.js Files Via CDN?

            => In Devlopment Mode We Can Enable And Utilize React Developer Tools Devtool Profiler Debugging Environment Attached With Source Code We Can Utilize Various Functionalities Such As Hot Module Replacement Diagnostics So That Development Enviornment Will Help Debug Code.

            => In Production Mode Compression And Minification Of Javascript And Other Resources Happens To Reduce Size Of The Code Which Is Not The Case When It Comes To Devlopment Mode Performance Will Much Faster In Production Mode When Compared To Devlopment mode.
            
            => Serving This Files Via CDN There Are A Few Key Differences Between Them File Size The React Devlopment File Typically Larger In Size Compared To React Production Mode The Development Version Contains Additional Code Comments,And Debugging Information That Aids In Development And Trobolshooting On The Other Hand Production Version Is Optimized For Performance And Had Undergose Various Optimization.

# What Is Async And Defer?
            => Async And Defer Both Load Javascript Asyncronously Without Render Blocking But Async Executes As Soon As Possible While Defer Runs In Sequence Toward End Of The Loading Process Just Before The Domcontent Loaded Event.
            => Async Allows Your Script To Run As Soon As It's Loaded, Without Blocking Other Elements On Page.
            => Defer Means Your Script Will Only Execute After The Page Has Finished Loading.
